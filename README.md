# Keybinds for City of Heroes / City of Villains
Used for making it easier to control pets, heal, etc. 

## General Notes
- Not organized just yet. 
- Purely Mastermind focused for the moment.

## Basic How to

## Load keybind file
In the Chat window type /bindloadfile "DRIVE:\Pathto\binds\...\...txt"

    Example: /bindloadfile "D:\CoV\binds\mm-ninja\all.txt"

**Note: Mastermind files are designed so once any of them are loaded, they can load others as needed for that mastermind.**
